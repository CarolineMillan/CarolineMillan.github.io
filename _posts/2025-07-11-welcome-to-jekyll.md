# Testing

This is just to test whether I've got Jekyll working correctly for uploading posts to the website.

<!-- I guess I can use this to write a list of things I want to write about.

- FPCW summary/readme
- graphics cw summary/readme
- compare graphics cw to path tracer
- changes you made when you revisited graphics cw
- motivations for making the chip-8 emulator
- from nand to tetris writeup
- boot.dev review
- linux setup
- recommended resources list

and a list of things to do:

- add closure to FPCW and get last q working
- fix bug in chip8

-->
